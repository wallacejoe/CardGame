# Overview

I created a basic card game and menu, allowing the user to choose difficulty settings, interact with cards, and exit the game from the main menu. I wrote this software as an expansion to my C# skills and an intro to Unity.

The game is played by first selecting a difficulty. You then race against the clock to empty your "deck". As you play cards, your deck comes closer to emptying.
To play cards, you drag them to an empty square in the center, or a square occupied by a number one higher or lower than the card being played. NOTE: 10 can be played on 1 and vice versa.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

- The UI sizing needs to be adjusted to fit different screen sizes
- Not necessary, but would like to add multiplayer features
